        <h1>Fedora</h1>
      </header>
      <p>She found me on December 29, 2009. I was still living with my parents and they didn't let me have more cats, so I called my boyfriend (now my husband) asking for help. He immediately told me that he would adopt her. That same night he went to my house to picked her up. It was <strong>love</strong> at first sight.</p>

        <h1>Bartolomeo</h1>
      </header>
      <p>I found him on March 7, 2014. He was abandoned outside of an old house that was on my way to work. This time, I was living with my husband and when I called him to tell him that I have found a baby cat (he was tiny, malnourished and sick) he wasnÂ´t very happy about it, but when I arrive to our apartment he fall in love again.</p>
