        <h1>Anastasia</h1>
      </header>
      <p>She is the oldest, she has been with me since February 27, 2007. When I got her I was still living with my parents, so after I  convince them that I could take proper care of pet, I found a posting that show her and her siblings after being drop at some girl front yard.</p>

        <h1>Fedora</h1>
      </header>
      <p>She found me on December 29, 2009. I was still living with my parents and they didn't let me have more cats, so I called my boyfriend (now my husband) asking for help. I think he immediately told me that he would adopt her. That same night he went to my house to pick her up and it was love at first sight.</p>

        <h1>Bartolomeo</h1>
      </header>
      <p>I found him on March 7, 2014. He was abandoned outside of an old house that was on my way to work. This time I was living with my husband and when I called him to tell him that I have found a baby cat (he was tiny, malnourished and sick) he was mad, but when I arrive to our apartment, he fall in love again.</p>
